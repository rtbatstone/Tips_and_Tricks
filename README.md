## Access rights of files
Useful website if you want to change access rights of files: https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/it-ops/linux-file-permissions.

To list access rights of files, type ``ls -l``. 

An example of the result is ``-rwxrw-r-- 1 ee51ab beng95 2450 Sept29 11:52 file1``

## Environmental variable

## Info server
Login to Info sever: type ``ssh username@info.mcmaster.ca``. Then type ``password`` (You don't see the characters when you enter the password). 

Exit Info server: type ``exit``.

## List (ls)
To list content in a directory, type ``ls``.

To list hidden files (files beginning with ``.``), type ``ls -a``. 

To list access rights of files, type ``ls -l``. 

## Working in background (nohup, screen)

## Symbolic link

## Tab complete
This saves time for typing out a command. 

For example, if you want to go to the **Applications** directory, you can type **"cd Applications"**. Instead of typing out **"Applications"** in full, you can type **"App"** and the press **"Tab"**. If **"Applications"** is the only directory beginning with **"App"**, it will return you **"cd Applications"**.
