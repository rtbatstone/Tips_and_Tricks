UNIX commands for beginners
## Tab complete
This saves time for typing out a command. 

For example, if you want to go to the **Applications** directory, you can **"cd Applications"**. Instead of typing out **"Applications"** in full, you can type **"App"** and the press **"Tab"**. If **"Applications"** is the only directory beginning with **"App"**, it will return you **"cd Applications"**.
